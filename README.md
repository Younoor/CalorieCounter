# CalorieCounter
This is a project I did for my programming 1 class.
It is supposed to take your input for how many calories you've burned for each day of the week.
Then the program creates a table for you of how many calories you've burned in the week.
Also at the end it tells you how much you've burned in the month.

Will update later with grade of what I got in class.
